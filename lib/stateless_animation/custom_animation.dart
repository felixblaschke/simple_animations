/// Widget that creates a customized animation.
///
/// You need to specify a [tween] that describes your animation
/// and [builder] function that is called each frame you are
/// animating. This function has signature of [AnimatedWidgetBuilder].
///
/// It's also useful to specify a [duration] (default is 1 second).
///
/// You can modify the internal `AnimationController` by setting the
/// [control] property to any value of [CustomAnimationControl).
/// By default it starts playing the animation.
///
/// Nice to know: both [duration] and [control] can be modified at any
/// time while using it inside a stateful widget.
///
/// To improve the performance of your animation you should put
/// all widgets that are not effected by the animation into the [child]
/// property. You get that child widget passed into the [builder]
/// function. See also [AnimatedWidgetBuilder].
///
/// If you specify a [delay] the animation will wait for the given
/// duration until it will started animating.
///
/// The [curve] parameter can be used to apply a non-linear animation
/// to your tween.
///
/// If you want to start your animation at alternative position, you
/// can set a [startPosition] that takes values between `0.0` (start)
/// and `1.0` (end).
///
/// You can optionally limit the framerate (fps) of the animation by
/// setting the [fps] value.
///
/// You can provide an [animationStatusListener] that gets called by
/// the internal `AnimationController`. It's receives events of the
/// type [AnimationStatus].
///
/// If you work with multiple animation widgets that are conditionally
/// rendered, you might want to set a [key]. Otherwise Flutter will
/// recycled your "old animation" which results in strange behavior.
///
/// You can connect this widget to the closest [AnimationDeveloperTools]
/// by setting [developerMode] to `true`.
